01/05/2006 : V 1.7

	- Removed the KEEPDBOPEN option as it could lead to multiple instance of gld running
	  when mail traffic is low and thus father process MYSQL connection timeout .
	  Furthermore, after tests, efficency is the same .
	 
	  KEEPDBOPEN option is now silently ignored to forced to NO .


16/09/2005 : V 1.6

	- Removed the algorithm lightgreydomain as the new mxgrey does better and simpler

	- Removed the UPDATE option, now gld always update triplets .

	- Fixed a minor flaw in the MXGREY algorithm.

	- Now you can configure MXGREY to consider an ip as a safe MX after X succesful
	  greylists instead of only 1 . (read gld.conf for details)

	- Now gld updates the counters only when mail is not greylisted

	- Added Training mode, read gld.conf for details

	- Now gld verify that if you supply a custom smtp code, it's a 4XX code
	  otherwise gld discard it and use 450 .

	- If gld cannot connect to MySQL server on startup
	  it will not refuse to run anymore, but will set keepdbopen to 0 and accept to run .

	- The sample config file provided now only listen to loopback
	  only accept connection from localhost and runs as nobody/ nobody.

	WARNING: if you were using lightgreydomain algorithm, it has been discontinued
	use MXGREY in place, please read gld.conf for details.
