Hello,

If you are reading this, this means that security is important for you
it's a good point, then please follow this simple rules to avoid future problems.


Rule #1: 
	Never run gld as root, run gld as a low privilege user, such nobody/nobody

Rule #2:
	If you have only one mail server, I advice you to run gld on it
	and to make sure that:
		- LOOPBACKONLY is set to 1
		- CLIENTS is set to 127.0.0.1/32
	This will only allow localhost to connect on gld which will listen only to localhost.
	This way, even if a buffer overflow,hack is found, no one would be able to exploit it remotly.

Rule #3: 
	If your gld server is not on your smtp server, please make sure that:
		- CLIENTS is set to your mail servers IPs only
	
	This way, only your mail servers will be allowed to connect on gld.
	This way, even if a buffer overflow,hack is found, no one would be able to exploit it remotly.


Rule #4:
	Make sure, you use the latest version and update on a regular basis.
